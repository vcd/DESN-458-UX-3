# Artist Statement
Our data, is worth more than our dollar. Each new web service promises greater conveniences and community, in exchange we (willingly) relinquish even more of own digital identity. The price is nothing - we expect everything to be free - however the costs are higher. This artist is guilty in this exchange by making, selling, and teaching how-to-design for it. Keep your dollar; we have the data needed.   

P. Colin Manikoth is faculty Lecturer at Eastern Washington University. The “P.” is for Poukong (or pretentious). Go to GiveUp.Agency to give-up more of your data.
